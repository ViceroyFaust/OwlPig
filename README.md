# Owl's C++ Pig game
This is Owl's (aka ViceroyFaust) C++ implementation of the classic game of pig.

## Rules
- 2 players
- Each player can roll a die as much as they like.
- Each player can stop rolling the die at any time, and "bank" their points.
- Rolls with numbers 2-6 are all added to the player's point pool.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all of their unbanked points and forfeit their turn.
- First player to reach 100 points wins.
